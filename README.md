I’m your friend Bryan Galicia, a begginer in Web Development and totally excited for new things comming!
I’m interested in several areas. At this moment I’m studying front-end technologies like JavaScript, React JS, CSS3 and HTML5, 
but I plan to continue learning about cybersecurity, virtual reality, blockchain and more...
